I was working with computers from an early age.

My memory of drawing mountains in `mspaint.exe` in Windows 98 is still vivid.

I remember my joy of successfully installing Windows XP, and, waiting for months to download 6GB Mac OS X Snow Leopard and build a Hackintosh :grinning\*face_with_star_eyes:.

I was introduced to programming with [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) and [LOGO](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo*(programming_language)>) and found them to be enjoyable. My real application-oriented programming started on the Hackintosh with me writing C programs to verify my Math homework :sweat_smile:! Later on, I learned many programming languages, thanks to nice IDEs and code suggestion support! Nowadays, I'm comfortable with many programming languages, since they share common ideologies.

During my formal CS education at [SJCE](https://sjce.ac.in/) and [NITK](https://www.nitk.ac.in/), I was working on several projects ranging from Client-Sever Systems, P2P Systems, and Deep Learning. You can check some of them in my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/vinayakakv)!

I'm in the IT industry for around a year and working with IaC using Pulumi, tooling using TypeScript and NodeJS, and, building UI using React. Currently, I'm exploring VueJS, GIS, and Functional Programming. Apart from my work, I also built [Benaka Malnad Stores](https://benakastores.com/), an E-Commerce website for our family-owned business.

Apart from programming, [I also hunt mountains, do photography and write about nature! ->](https://vinayakakv.com)

Feel free to [reach out to me](#contact) if you want to talk anything about programming, environment, and coffee :coffee:!
