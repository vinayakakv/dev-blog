  Sorry, Lazy to write, [go check the full article](#), its all about how
  **hard** it is to be _lazy_!

In my last article [Lazy is easy](/blog/lazy-is-easy),  I implemented lazy
loading the properties of a JS object, with full type-safety. There was one
caveat, though -- we named the properties as variable names (`name`), when they
were the getters. Ideally, we could have named them `getName`, and `Proxy`
convert the access to the `name` to call to `getName`. This, however, adds
couple of interesting challenges from the TS domain, which we shall go through
in this article.

## Enforcing the Property Names as `get<Something>`

This is one of the first requirements of the problem. Let's go ahead and modify
the `LazyInput` type from the previous article to support this.

```diff
 type LazyInput = {
-  [key: string]: () => any
+  [key: GetterName]: () => any
 }
```

The `GetterName` type enforces that the string should start with `get`,
followed by an uppercase character and any string.

```typescript
type GetterName = `get${UppercaseLetters}${string}`
```

We can define `UppercaseLetters` as an union of all uppercase letter literals,
but I'm lazy to do that :sweat_smile:. Instead, let's define a constant string
containing all lowercase characters, and split it somehow to a union of
uppercase characters.

```typescript
const letters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

type Split<T extends string> =
  T extends `${infer First}${infer Rest}`
    ? First | Split<Rest>
    : never

type LowercaseLetters = Split<typeof letters>

type UppercaseLetters = Uppercase<LowercaseLetters>
```

Here, type `Split` is recursively splitting input to union until it is empty.
We then use TS-inbuilt type `Uppercase` to get the desired union.

## Deriving the property name from `GetterName`

In the Proxied lazy object, we want to _access properties_, not _call getters_.
Let's create a type to convert `GetterName` to property names. For example,
this type would convert `getPropertyName` to `propertyName`. Here, we are

- removing the `get` from the begining of the string
- converting the next letter to lowercase
- keeping the reamining part as it is.

```typescript
type PropertyName<T extends GetterName> =
  T extends `get${infer FirstLetter}${infer Name}`
    ? `${Lowercase<FirstLetter>}${Name}`
    : never
```

Let's try it in action.

```typescript
type t1 = PropertyName<"getPropertyName"> // = propertyName
type t2 = PropertyName<"setPropertyName"> // Error
type t3 = PropertyName<"getpropertyName"> // Error 
```

Now that we get it working, let's implement the return type of our new `lazy`
function.

## The new `Lazy`

Armed with the type `PropertyName`, we can now define the `Lazy` type as:

```typescript
type Lazy<T extends LazyInput> = {
  [K in keyof T as PropertyName<
    K & GetterName
  >]: ReturnType<T[K & GetterName]>;
}
```

There are several differences here from previous article:

- We are _renaming_ the keys here using `as` operator to `PropertyName`
- While doing so, we are intersecting the key type `K` with `GetterName` to
ensure we pass in the right types.

Let's check if that works:

```typescript
type t1 = Lazy<{}> // = {}
type t2 = Lazy<{
  getX: () => number,
  getLongProperty: () => string
}> // = {x: number, longProperty: string}
type t3 = Lazy<{
  hello: number
}> // = {}
```

Cool, our type _seems_ to work, except on `t3`, where I thought TS should give
us an error. Let's dig deep and understand why it is not happening.

## Enter the TS Rabbithole

Let's look closely at the definition of `Lazy<T>`, where we defined a
_constraint_ on `T` that it should _extend_ `LazyInput`. Let's check if the
type `{hello: number}` satisfies that constraint.

```typescript
type test = {hello: number} extends LazyInput ? true: false // = true
```

Woah, seems like TS is doing something wrong here :open_mouth:, although we
specify the key format in `LazyInput`, TS is not respecting that at all! To
investigate this further, let's supply a `GetterName` key, but with an invalid
value (say `number`)

```typescript
type test = {getHello: number} extends LazyInput ? true: false // = false
```

Ah, now it is `false` and TS seems back alive. Does it mean that TS is
validating the type of the values, but not the keys:thinking:? Btw, what does
the `extends` is checking, exactly?

### The `extends` Keyword in Type Expressions

Let's think of extending a class in object oriented languages. The extended
class (a.k.a _subtype_) has all the properties (and methods) of its parent
class (a.k.a _supertype_) along with some of its own (also overrides). In TS
also, inheritance works in the same way. Let's go back to some examples now.
Here, I'm using `interface` to make use of `extends` keyword; we can achieve
the same things with `type` and intersection using `&`.

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string,
  age: number
}

interface PersonWithPhone extends Person {
  phoneNumber: string
}

interface PersonWithHealthInfo extends Person {
  bloodGroup: string
}

type t1 = PersonWithHealthInfo extends Person ? true: false // = true
type t2 = PersonWithPhone extends Person? true: false // = true
type t3 = {} extends Person? true: false // = false
type t4 = Person extends Person? true: false // = true
type t5 = {name: string} extends Person? true: false // = false
```

Here, the `extends` keyword is both used to create subtypes and check if a type
is subtype of another, and the results are as what we expect -- if a type
contains all properties of `Person`, the `extends` check returns `true`.
Keeping this model in mind, let's go beyond pre-defined properties to explore
what happens in case of keyed properties.

Let's consider back our `LazyInput` type, with some simplifications. 

```typescript
type LazyInputSimplified = {
  [key: GetterName]: number
}
```

Let's look at some valid and invalid _values_ for this type:

```typescript
const e1: LazyInputSimplified = {} // valid
const e2: LazyInputSimplified = {"hello": 1, "world": 2} // invalid
const e3: LazyInputSimplified = {2: 5} // invalid
const e4: LazyInputSimplified = {"getA": 3} // valid
```

This is also as expected. Note that the empty object is also a valid value.
Let's think what values a subtype (say `T`) of `LazyInputSimplified` can have
of. By definition of subtyping,

- It can have all the values that `LazyInput` can have, along with
- **It can define its own values.**

The point that `T` can define extra properties is the key here. Since empty
object is also a valid `LazyInputSimplified` value, we are free to add _any_
keys to it as long as we don't touch `GetterName` and provide it with an
invalid value (other than `number`). To make it clear:

```typescript
type t1 = {} extends LazyInputSimplified ? true: false // = true
type t2 = {hi: "hello"} extends LazyInputSimplified? true: false // = true
type t3 = {hi: "hello", getA: boolean} extends LazyInputSimplified? true: false
// = false
type t4 = {hi: "hello", getA: number, getB: number} extends
LazyInputSimplified? true: false // = true
```

- `t1` is `true`, as empty object type is a valid `LazyInputSimplified`
- `t2` is `true`, as it defined extra keys than `LazyInputSimplified`
- `t3` is `false`, as it violated `LazyInputSimplified` constraint in `{getA:
boolean}`
- `t4` is `true`, as it defines extra keys than `{getA: 3, getB: 4}` , a valid
`LazyInputSimplified`

Now we know why `type test = {hello: number} extends LazyInput ? true: false //
= true` was true. It did extend `LazyInput` by defining an extra key `hello`.
We did not define in `LazyInput` what extra keys should look like. Let's look
how we can disallow extra keys altogether!

### Restricting the Generic Parameter

Now, we can frame our problem statement more abstractly. We have two types `T`
and `U`, where `T` is a subtype of `U` (that is, `T extends U`). Remember that
`T` can define extra properties than `U`, now we want to get rid of them. To do
that, we should:

- Loop over all keys `k` of `T`
- If `k` is a key of `U` also, we proceed to compare the value types
  - If `U[k]` is a subtype of  `T[k]`, we keep it as it is
  - otherwise, we set `T[k]` to be `never` so that we disallow any values there
- Otherwise, we set the value to `never` so that we disallow all the values to
key `k`.

This way, we keep all the keys `k`, but set the values to `never`, so that any
assignment to that key results in a type error. The type implementing this
logic now looks as:

```typescript
type Restrict<T extends U, U> = {
  [Key in keyof T]: Key extends keyof U
    ? U[Key] extends T[Key]
      ? T[Key]
      : never
    : never
}
```

With this type, let's validate our assumptions on `LazyInputSimplified`:

```typescript
type t1 = Restrict<{}, LazyInputSimplified>
// type t1 = {}
type t2 = Restrict<{hi: "hello"}, LazyInputSimplified>
// type t2 = {hi: never}
type t3 = Restrict<{hi: "hello", getA: false}, LazyInputSimplified>
// Error, violates generic constraint
type t4 = Restrict<{hi: "hello", getA: number, getB: number},
LazyInputSimplified>
// type t4 = { hi: never; getA: number; getB: number; }

```

As we see from the above examples, we get `never` on incompatible properties,
thus preventing them from assigning. Now, we can redefine `Lazy` using new
`Restrict` utility:

```typescript
type Lazy<T extends LazyInput> = T extends Restrict<
  T,
  LazyInput
>
  ? {
      [K in keyof T as PropertyName<
        K & GetterName
      >]: ReturnType<T[K & GetterName]>
    }
  : never
```

The core part of the type is still the same. On top of that, we check if `T`
contains any restricted keys, returning `never` if so. With that, our first
example becomes,

```typescript
type t1 = Lazy<{}> // = {}
type t2 = Lazy<{
  getX: () => number,
  getLongProperty: () => string
}> // = {x: number, longProperty: string}
type t3 = Lazy<{
  hello: number
}> // = never
```

Which is now cool, as it says we can't have incompatible keys on the `Lazy`
type. However, we still have to enforce it at the compile time, which we now do
at the function definition part. Finally, we are out of the TS rabbithole
:tada:.

## The new `lazy()`

Now, let's begin the fun part of implementing the actual `lazy` method using
Proxies. Rememember, we need to

- Take a property name
- Convert it to getter name
- Call the getter function, cache the result and return it.

To do this, let's start by implementing a function to get the getter name given
the property name.

```typescript
const getterName = (prop: string) => {
  const [first, ...rest] = prop.split("")
  return ["get", first!.toUpperCase(), ...rest].join(
    ""
  ) as GetterName
}
```

Then, we can proceed to implement the `lazy()` method as,

```typescript
const lazy = <T extends Restrict<T, LazyInput>>(
  object: T
) => {
  const cache = {} as any
  return new Proxy(object, {
    get(target, prop) {
      if (!(prop in cache)) {
        // Forward symbol | number to original object
        if (typeof prop !== "string")
          cache[prop] = target[prop as keyof T]
        else {
          const getter = (target as LazyInput)[getterName(prop)]
          cache[prop] = getter ? getter() : undefined
        }
      }
      return cache[prop]
    }
  }) as any as Lazy<T>
}

```

Some notes here:

- We can not return `Proxy` as `Lazy` as we did earlier, as the keys are also
different. Since we are sure about this, we do `as any as Lazy<T>`
- We also type `cache` as `any` where we could have used `Lazy<T>`. This is
simply to save ourselves from lots of type castings throughout!
- We choose to forward `number | symbol` accesses to original object as it is,
while doing so, we have to convert `prop` to `keyof T` as we are not doing any
modifications to key here.
- To get the type-safe version of `getter`, we are first casting `target` to
`LazyInput` (which is `Restrict<T, LazyInput>`)

Phew, that's lots of TS manipulations even when we are writing the logic part.
Anyway, let's go ahead and test the `lazy()` method we just implemented:

```typescript
const logAndReturn = <T>(arg: T) => {
  console.log("Logging", arg)
  return arg
}

const object = {
  getBoolean: () => logAndReturn(true),
  getString: () => logAndReturn("hello world"),
  getNumber: () => logAndReturn(21),
}

const lazyObject = lazy(object)
console.log(lazyObject.boolean) // Logging true, true
console.log(lazyObject.boolean) // true

console.log({ ...lazyObject }) // {getBoolean: undefined, ...}
```

Our results are bittersweet:

- We got successful type inference for the type of the `lazyObject`
- Caching is also working, we are seeing the `logAndReturn` call for only the
first access
- _However_, destructuring and logging the object does not seem to get hang of
new property names yet...

Let's go ahead and fix the problem for good.

## Enter the JS Rabbithole

When we are overriding `get` method in the `Proxy` handler, we want to somehow
tell the JS that we have new keys. Fortunately, we can also override the
`ownKeys` method to return the new keys. To do that, we

- First, get the key names from underlying object. Remember, they are getters.
- Map them to property names, let's write an utility function for that.

```typescript
const propertyName = <T extends GetterName>(
  getterName: T
): PropertyName<T> => {
  const [first, ...r] = getterName.slice(3).split("")
  return [first!.toLowerCase(), ...r].join(
    ""
  ) as PropertyName<T>
}
```

Let's override the `ownKeys` method also:

```typescript
const lazy = <T extends Restrict<T, LazyInput>>(
  object: T
) => {
  // same as before
  return new Proxy(object, {
    // same as before
    ownKeys(target) {
      return Object.keys(target)
        .map((getter) => propertyName(getter as GetterName))
    },
  })
}
```

Then, in the driver,

```typescript
const object = // same as before
const lazyObject = // same as before
console.log(Object.keys(lazyObject)) // []
```

Wow, it is still `[]` :cry:. Without `ownKeys` override though, it was
`["getBoolean", "getString", "getNumber"]`. We are still better than that, but
have to make our new keys visible to JS. Turns out that we have to make them
`enumerable` and `configurable`. To do this, we can override the
`getOwnPropertyDescriptor` of the proxy handler:

```typescript
const lazy = <T extends Restrict<T, LazyInput>>(
  object: T
) => {
  // same as before
  return new Proxy(object, {
    // same as before
    getOwnPropertyDescriptor() {
      return {
        enumerable: true,
        configurable: true,
      }
    },
  })
}
```

With this, let's go to the driver again:

```typescript
const object = // same as before
const lazyObject = // same as before
console.log(Object.keys(lazyObject)) // ["boolean", "string", "number"]
// Destruct to force evaluate all keys
console.log({ ...lazyObject }) // {boolean: true, string: "hello world",
number: 21}

```

Nice, we are seeing the expected things now :smile:.

## Closing thoughts

With all the back and forth with the TS and JS Proxies, we were able to
implement a version of `lazy` that does lazy evaluation and caching along with
key mapping. If we pass in an non-matching key to the argument of `lazy`, it is
an runtime error as well as compile time one.

```typescript
const object = {
  getBoolean: () => logAndReturn(true),
  getString: () => logAndReturn("hello world"),
  getNumber: () => logAndReturn(21),
  x: 33,
}

// error here: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'never'.
const lazyObject = lazy(object)
console.log(lazyObject.boolean)
console.log(lazyObject.boolean)
// Runtime error here, calling ownKeys, error in propertyName
console.log(Object.keys(lazyObject))

console.log({ ...lazyObject })
```

The logic in type domain and the runtime is tightly coupled. This is not
without limitations, though. Not passing an object literal to `lazy` might not
give you all the benifits, and type errors are hard to debug many times.
However, this shows the power of what TS can do at type level. As usual, I
dread writing of `PropertyName` type and `propertyName` function having same
logic -- this is unavoidable as of now, until we have (can we?) a TS runtime
with access to types.

## Get your hands Dirty!

Try this code sample in
[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/optimistic-elbakyan-fkjo9t?file=/src/index.ts).

## Caveats

- For a `Record<string, string>`, although we have specified string keys, we
can have number keys. This is due to JS internally converting number index
access to string access.

  - ```typescript
    const x: Record<string, string> =  {2: "Hi"} // valid
    ```

- The `Restrict<>` type seems incomplete, for example, a call to `lazy(2)` is
still valid, though I didn't understand why this works yet. Maybe a TS Bug?
:thinking:

- Anything else, you tell me!
