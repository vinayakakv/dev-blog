tldr: |
  
  - I implemented Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for an [e-commerce
  website](https://benakastores.com) that I built using NextJS
  - To trigger ISR, I built a GraphCMS [UI
  Extension](https://graphcms.com/docs/ui-extensions) (UIX)
  - The UIX is configured with `ENDPOINT` and `API_KEY`
  - The UIX contains a button, on clicking which, a `POST` call is made to
  `ENDPOINT` with the JSON body containing the data of the object being edited
  and the `Authorization` header set to `Bearer ${API_KEY}`
  - I used the ISR handler path as the `ENDPOINT`
  - Since the ISR handler and the trigger are hosted in different domains, I
  needed to enable CORS by specifying `Access-Control` HTTP headers on the
  response
  - The UIX is available at
  [graphcms-uix-trigger-api.vercel.app](https://graphcms-uix-trigger-api.vercel.app/),
  with source open at
  [GitHub](https://github.com/vinayakakv/graphcms-uix-trigger-api)
  - In the future, I plan to add more fields to the UIX, along with implementing
  `no-cors` requests, depending on the use cases that arise

Static Site Generation (SSG) is great. It allows faster response time to users
and enhanced SEO capabilities. I use SSG for all my websites, including an
[e-commerce](https://benakastores.com) store that [I built](/blog/no-code-code)
for our family business. The website uses [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and
[Hygraph](https://hygraph.com/). While everything ran great with SSG, the
ongoing inflation triggered some problems by frequently varying prices. To
update the price of an item, this was my workflow:

1. Update the price in Hygraph
2. Publish the content
3. Trigger static site rebuild on Vercel

Since the price change only affected a few pages, rebuilding the entire website
is an unnecessary task. Fortunately, [Incremental Static Regeneration
(ISR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration)
comes to our rescue. ISR can be triggered either periodically, or, on-demand.
In this article, I will go through my idea of the solution and how I
implemented it.

## The Idea

My idea was to do every step of the process in a single place. It would be
Hygraph, as the price editing happens there. I imagined the following workflow:

1. Update the price in Hygraph
2. Publish the content
3. Click a button somewhere in the Hygraph content editor to trigger ISR on the
pages affected

Thanks to the Hygraph [UI Extensions](https://hygraph.com/docs/ui-extensions)
(UIX, currently in preview), which enhances its UI functionality,  this
workflow was possible. I decided to use them with the following mechanism:

- The website provides a `POST` endpoint (say `/api/revalidate`) to trigger ISR
- The UIX provides a button, on clicking which, calls the endpoint with the
current object data in the body

### Building the Hygraph UIX

Before building the UIX, I doubted whether it can access the current object
being edited.
[@cadudecastroalves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cadudecastroalves/) from
Hygraph Community cleared my doubt and pointed me to the documentation.

Hygraph UIX is essentially a React application, which gets rendered inside the
Hygraph editor UI. I initially bootstrapped the project with
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and found that Hygraph could not connect to the
extension in the development mode. Since it was a known problem, I decided to
go with [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/).

To get started, I just had to install
[@hygraph/uix-react-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hygraph/uix-react-sdk)
package and import `Wrapper` and `useFormExtension` from it. Using them, the
UIX skeleton would look like,

```tsx
import {
  Wrapper,
  useFormSidebarExtension,
  FormSidebarExtensionDeclaration,
} from "@hygraph/uix-react-sdk"

const declaration: FormSidebarExtensionDeclaration = {
  name: "Name your UIX here",
  description: "Describe what your UIX does",
  extensionType: "formSidebar", // This extenstion will appear at the sidebar
  config: {
    // Declare any user-defined values that you are going to need in your UIX
  },
}

function SidebarComponent() {
  // form contains the state of the current object being edited in the Hygraph
  // extenstion contains UIX metadata, along with config values
  // model contains the information about the model of which current object is
an instance of
  const { form, extension, model } =
    useFormSidebarExtension()
  // Do something useful using the form and extension variables
  // You can use useEffect() with form as a dependency to listen to changes
  return <p>Your UI goes here!</p>
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Wrapper declaration={declaration}>
      <SidebarComponent />
    </Wrapper>
  )
}

export default App
```

For my use case, I had the following config variables:

- `ENDPOINT` -- The endpoint on which to trigger `POST`
- `API_KEY` -- The secret to be added in the `Authorization` header

I also added several state variables to the skeleton:

- A boolean state variable `dirty` to check if the form had been modified

- An object state variable `values` to store the value of the current object
being edited in Hygraph

- An effect depending on the `form` to update `dirty` and `values`

- A callback to call `ENDPOINT`

- A boolean state variable `loading` set true if an API call is in progress

- A string state variable `message` to notify the user of the result of the API
call.

The UI was very simple, containing a button to trigger the callback, and a
paragraph to display the `message`. In the end, the UIX config looked like
this:

The UIX UI was simple:

The UIX source is available at
[GitHub](https://github.com/vinayakakv/hygraph-uix-trigger-api); you can also
install the extension available at
[hygraph-uix-trigger-api.vercel.app](https://hygraph-uix-trigger-api.vercel.app/)
from Hygraph settings.

### The ISR Handler

With the extension in place, it was time to implement the ISR handler! In
NextJS, the ISR handler is a normal API handler that triggers the`
unstable_revalidate()` function on the response object. This function takes a
path as the input and triggers ISR. For security purposes, it is good to use a
secret as the authentication mechanism, to control the triggers of the API.

Since the UIX sends the whole object being edited, it was necessary to type (at
least a part) of them in the ISR handler. At Hygraph, I had `Product` and
`Category` schemas, each containing a `slug` field and were related two-way. I
also had the `Info` schema, as a key-value pair. The typings looked like this:

```typescript
type HasSlug = { slug: string }

// This is how Hygraph defines relationships
type HygraphReference<T extends string, K> = {
  [key in T]: {
    connect: K[]
    disconnect: K[]
  }
}

type ProductRevalidateData = HasSlug &
  HygraphReference<"categories", HasSlug>

type CategoryRevalidateData = HasSlug &
  HygraphReference<"products", HasSlug>

type RequestData =
  | ({ model: "Product" } & ProductRevalidateData)
  | ({ model: "Category" } & CategoryRevalidateData)
  | { model: "Info" }

```

I also had a `getPaths(req: RequestData): string[]` method to return a list of
all paths to be revalidated. The method would calculate the paths based on the
request data being sent from the Hygraph. With this method in place, the ISR
handler was as simple as:

```typescript
export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse<ResponseData>
) {
  if (req.method === "POST") {
    const authToken =
      req.headers["authorization"]?.split(" ")[1]
    if (authToken !== process.env.REVALIDATION_TOKEN) {
      res.status(401).end()
      return
    }
    const request: RequestData = JSON.parse(req.body)
    const paths = getPaths(request)
    await Promise.all(
      paths.map(path => res.unstable_revalidate(path))
    )
    res.status(200).send({ success: true })
  } else {
    res.status(204).end()
  }
}

```

While testing this code, I spent around half an hour debugging the ISR not
triggering. It was due to missing `await Promise.all()` around
`res.unstable_revalidate()` calls :sweat_smile:.

## Caveats and Possible Improvements

The Hygraph UIX calls the API by using `fetch()`. While doing the API call, the
`Origin` header will be set to the domain at which the UIX is hosted. If the
CORS is not enabled at the API server, the browser will block the request. To
handle this, I had to set CORS headers in the API response as:

```typescript
res
  .setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
  .setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", [
    "POST",
    "OPTIONS",
  ])
  .setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", [
    "authorization",
    "content-type",
  ])

```

This will set the headers for all HTTP methods, even though the browser will
call only `POST` and `OPTIONS`. In case modifying the server configuration to
enable CORS is not possible, the UIX can use `mode: "no-cors"` in the
`fetch()`, at a cost of making the response
[opaque](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-filtered-response-opaque).

When the Hygraph UIX supports Vite during the development, I plan to migrate
the project to Vite, for a nice DX. Apart from that, the UIX can also have an
option to specify resource paths, when adding to the sidebar of a model. Feel
free to open a PR if that is the use case that you need!
