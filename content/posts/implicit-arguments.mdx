While exploring Scala, one of the features that caught my eyes was that
functions can accept two sets of arguments. Typically, we write `function
name(argumentList)` in most languages. Scala goes one step ahead and allows
`function name(argumentList)(implicitArgumentList)`. In this article, we shall
explore implicit arguments from a Scala-newbie perspective. meaning that we
won't dig deep into architectural patterns and theoretical implications,
rather, we explore them from a syntax and syntax-sugar perspective.

## A First Dive

Let's write a function to concatenate a list of strings with a separator. As a
good first step, we write this as a function accepting two arguments and a
return value

```scala
def concatStrings(strings: Seq[String], separator: String): String = {
  strings.foldRight("") {_ + separator + _}
}
```

Several things are going on here, let's break them down one by one:

- Scala uses `[]` to denote generics; thus, `Seq[String]` is a `Seq` of
`String`s

- The return value is the value of the last line of the function; writing
`return` is optional

- `foldRight` is similar to `reduce` function in JS, its first argument is the
initial value `""`

- `foldRight` takes a reducer function as a
[_curried_](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/multiple-parameter-lists.html)
argument

- The reducer function is of type `(String, B) => B`, The type `B` comes from
the initial value, which is also `String` now

- The funny `_`s are a shorthand to access function arguments; the First `_` is
of type `String`, and the second `_` is of type `B` (= `String`). You can't
write a third `_`,  that's an error :sweat_smile:

- `{...}` is a shorthand for the funciton body, otherwise you would have
written `strings.foldRight("")((a, b) => a + separator + b)`; Notice two set of
arguments `foldRight()()`, don't worry, we will address it right away :smile:

Then, we invoke this function and get a return value from anywhere.

```scala
def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  val strings = Seq("Hello", "World")
  val result = concatStrings(strings, "+")
  assert(result == "Hello+World+") // The extra + is because of foldRight
}
```

## Hello Implicit!

Let's make our function `concatStrings` to accept an implicit `separator`
argument. The function body looks similar to the previous case, excpet the
argument list:

```scala
def concatStrings(strings: Seq[String])(implicit separator: String): String = {
  strings.foldRight("")((a, b) => a + separator + b)
}
```

The second set of arguments begins with the `implicit` keyword and marks them
as _implicit_. The implicit arguments are inferred from the scope at
compile-time and passed to the function as an argument. To make it clear, let's
look at the invocation of our new `concatStrings` function.

```scala
def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  val strings = Seq("Hello", "World")
  implicit val delimiter: String = "+"
  val result = concatStrings(strings)
  assert(result == "Hello+World+")
}
```

Here, we are creating a constant named `delimiter` of type `String`, which is
also declared as `implicit`. When the compiler encounters the call to
`concatStrings`, it looks for values of type `String` in the scope, which is
marked as `implicit`. In this case, it is the constant `delimiter`. Then, it is
passed as an argument to the function.

Let's play with implicit arguments by modifying the code.

### Missing Implicit

If the compiler can not find `implicit` values in the scope, it is an error.

```scala
def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  val strings = Seq("Hello", "World")
  val result = concatStrings(strings)
  assert(result == "Hello+World+")
}
```

Here, the compiler complains with a readable, understandable error

```
could not find implicit value for parameter separator: String
	val result = concatStrings(strings)
```

### Multiple Implicits

If we have multiple `implicit` values of the same type, that is also an error.

```scala
def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  val strings = Seq("Hello", "World")
  implicit val delimiter: String = "+"
  implicit val anotherDelimiter: String = "+"
  val result = concatStrings(strings)
  assert(result == "Hello+World+")
}
```

The error is

```
ambiguous implicit values:
 both value anotherDelimiter of type String
 and value delimiter of type String
 match expected type String
    val result = concatStrings(strings)
```

### Explicitly Implicit

We can also explicitly pass the `implicit` argument, as we did in `foldRight()`

```scala
def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  val strings = Seq("Hello", "World")
  val result = concatStrings(strings)("+") // Notice the second argument list
  assert(result == "Hello+World+")
}
```

### Implicit from Upper Scope

Implicit values can be from upper scope as well:

```scala
object ImplicitHelper {
  def concatStrings(): String = {
    // Same as before
  }
}

object Main {
  implicit val delimiter: String = "+"
  
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val strings = Seq("Hello", "World")
    val result = ImplicitHelper.concatStrings(strings)
    assert(result == "Hello+World+")
  }
}
```

Here, the `object ...` is a singleton object, which can define methods as well.
Think of it as a `static` method. When we have implicit values present in
multiple scopes, the closest one is picked first (as expected :grin:).

```scala
object ImplicitHelper {} // Same as before

object Main {
  implicit val delimiter: String = "+"

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val strings = Seq("Hello", "World")
    implicit val delimiter: String = "_" // This one is picked
    val result = ImplicitHelper.concatStrings(strings)
    assert(result == "Hello_World_")
  }
}
```

Implicits can flow in from `import` as well, suppose we have an `object` named
`Config` in the file `Config`

```scala
// Config.scala
object Config {
  implicit val delimiter: String = ","
}
```

In our `Main.scala` (in which we write the `main` function),

```scala
// Main.scala
import Config._

object ImplicitHelper {} // Same as before

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val strings = Seq("Hello", "World")
    val result = ImplicitHelper.concatStrings(strings)
    assert(result == "Hello,World,")
  }
}
```

Since we imported every member of the object `Config`, the compiler can match
the `delimiter` to the argument of `contactStrings`

## Viewing Implicit Arguments

Since the implicit arguments can be inferred directly from the code without
analyzing all the imports in all scopes, debugging others' code can be hard.
Fortunately, IntelliJ has an option to _explicitly_ show the `implicit`
variables :tada:. Just enable it from `View -> Show Implicit Hints` (you might
need Scala Plugin to do this). With this option enabled, the editor window
looks like this,

![IntelliJ Idea showing implicit
argument](https://media.graphassets.com/GSdBIKACSz2g9SW9r5ai)

Now you can follow the definition of the value as usual.

## Implicit Conversions

Since functions are the first-class citizens of Scala, they can be an
`implicit` argument as well, here is a sample:

```scala
import scala.language.implicitConversions

object ImplicitHelper {
  def toInt[A](argument: A)(implicit function: (A) => Int): Int =
function(argument)
}

object Main {
  implicit def length(string: String): Int = string.length

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val string = "Hii"
    val result = ImplicitHelper.toInt(string)
    assert(result == 3)
  }
}
```

Here, the object method `Main.length` is the implicit parameter to the `toInt`
function. Note that we also needed to import
`scala.language.implicitConversions`. To quote the [Scala
Docs](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/implicit-conversions.html), we need
this,

> Because implicit conversions can have pitfalls if used indiscriminately the
compiler warns when compiling the implicit conversion definition.

So, we are making it explicit that we are using implicit conversions :smile:
(BTW, conversion = function).

## Implicitly Implicit :sunglasses:

We have already seen that we can bring in `implicit` values in the scope using
`import`. If we can have multiple `implicit` values defined in the imported
classes, we have some interesting effects.

Let's take the earlier example of `concatStrings()`. We have a `DefaultConfig`
object setting delimiter to `","`, and a `SpecialConfig` object setting it to
`"+"`. Let's also have these files:

1. `ImplicitHelper.scala` -- Defines `concatStrings` method
2. `Main.scala` -- Invokes the `contactStrings` method
3. `DefaultConfig.scala`, and
4. `SpecialConfig.scala` -- as defined earlier

Now, 

```scala
// DefaultConfig.scala
object DefaultConfig {
  implicit val delimiter: String = ","
}
```

And,

```scala
// SpecialConfig.scala
object SpecialConfig {
  implicit val delimiter: String = "+"
}
```

And,

```scala
// ImplicitHelper.scala
object ImplicitHelper {} // As before
```

At last,

```scala
import ImplicitHelper._
import DefaultConfig._

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val strings = Seq("Hello", "World")
    val result = concatStrings(strings)
    assert(result == "Hello,World,")
  }
}
```

Since we `import DefaultConfig._`, the delimiter is now `","`. We can quickly
swap that for `SpecialConfig._` to have a different delimiter.

```scala
import ImplicitHelper._
import SpecialConfig._

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val strings = Seq("Hello", "World")
    val result = concatStrings(strings)
    assert(result == "Hello+World+")
  }
}	
```

  And, the import order does not matter.

## Concluding Thoughts

The `implicit` arguments, especially through `import` provide a nice way to
implement composability and dependency injection patterns. Thanks to the
tooling, we still get the benefits of following arguments to their definitions.
Sometimes, like in implicit conversions, we still need to be careful not to
misuse them.
