  - We try to look into how we can make TS work for us using inference, rather
  than manually typing everything
  - We take an example of an MQ listener where we want to validate incoming
  messages against a `zod` schema and process them if validation is successful
  - We try to implement the generic function `listener<T>` with `(schema,
  handler)` with `T` being the type of the message. We hit roadblocks when
  deriving the type for `schema`
  - We try to go the other way round, by making the `schema` as `T`, then
  deriving the type of message as `z.infer<T>`, which works beautifully
  - We learn that choosing the right parameter to be generic is important when
  the parameters are interdependent 
  - We then proceed to split our code into library and application code, where
  the library does most of the TS heavy lifting. The application code contains no
  manual typings but comes with strong type checks, describing the power of
  inference.

There is a big portion of people who hate TypeScript because they think they
need to type _everything_ and it makes the code ugly and unreadable. While
typing everything does take the ergonomics away, TypeScript **does not** force
you to type everything - if you type the key parts of your code and logic (most
of the time, they are libraries), it can _infer_ the type in the rest of the
places. In this article, I will take you through an example where we need to
type the core and reap the benefits of inference everywhere else.

## The Problem

We want to define an MQ listener, that

- Could validate the incoming messages to be a JSON
- Could validate the JSON to follow a certain schema
- Execute the async handler function with the parsed object
- The handler returns a boolean indicating whether the execution of the message
was successful 

For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that the `listener` is a Higher-order
function (i.e., which takes another function as input) taking the `handler`
function as an input along with the `schema`. For parsing schema, we will use
`zod`.

For the solution to be valid, the `listener` should **only** accept the
`handler`s that take the type specified by `schema` as the input. If this is
not the case, it should be a TypeScript error, not a runtime error.

Based on the requirements above, we know that the `listener` function would
look something like this:

```typescript
const listener = (schema, handler) => {/*...*/}
```

The fun part is to type the function now -- what should be the type of `schema`
and `handler`? Before doing that, let's familiarise ourselves with `zod` and
the utilities that it provides.

## Zod 101

[Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) is a schema definition and object
parsing library. First, we define a schema using the primitives that `zod`
provides, and then we can access the `parse` method of the schema, which
validates the passed-in object and throws a `ZodError` in case parsing fails
(for those you fear exceptions - I do, in most of the cases - there is a
`safeParse` method which returns a `{success: true, data: T} | {success: false,
error: ZodError}`).

The type of the schema is `ZodSchema` most of the time, if you do some
post-parsing calculations, it will be `ZodEffects`. They have a very good
utility `infer` to get a plain type from `ZodSchema` and `ZodEffects`. Let's
get our hands dirty and see some code in action!

```typescript
import { z } from "zod"

const pageViewEventSchema = z.object({
  type: z.literal("pageView"),
  title: z.string().min(1),
  url: z.string().min(1),
  additionalInfo: z.optional(z.record(z.string(), z.any()))
})
```

The schema definition is very much like the type definition, but with
additional flexibility to define further validations like `min(1)` (which says
that the string must be at least of length 1). Using this schema is
straightforward:

```typescript
const unparsedOject = {
  /* This can be anything that comes from outside of the system
   * For example - user inputs, API call body, messages etc
   */
}

try {
  const pageViewEvent = pageViewEventSchema.parse(unparsedObject)
  // Now do something with pageViewEventSchema
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof ZodError) {/* handle the parsing error */}
}
```

If you are scared of expectations like me, you can use `safeParse`

```typescript
const parseResult = pageViewEventSchema.safeParse(unparsedObject)
if (parseResult.success) {
  const pageViewEvent = parseResult.data 
  // Now do something with pageViewEventSchema
} else {
  const e = parseResult.error
  // Handle the parsing error
}
```

In both cases, the constant `pageViewEvent` would be of the following type:

```typescript
{
  type: "pageView", // Note that this is a literal, not a string
  title: string,
  url: string,
  additionalInfo?: Record<string, any> // Record is a TS-inbuilt type  
}
```

To derive the type automatically, we can use `infer` utility:

```typescript
type PageViewEvent = z.infer<typeof pageViewEventSchema>
```

Note that the `infer` works for `ZodEffect`s as well. Following is the example
of an effect, where we set `additonalInfo` to an empty object if we do not
receive it (i.e., it is `undefined`).

```typescript
const pageViewEventSchemaWithEffect = z.object({
  type: z.literal("pageView"),
  title: z.string().min(1),
  url: z.string().min(1),
  additionalInfo: z.optional(z.record(z.string(), z.any()))
}).transform(
  // This is executed after the successful parsing with the parsed object as
input
  (result) => ({ ...result, additionalInfo: result.additionalInfo || {} })
);

type PageViewEventWithEffect = z.infer<typeof pageViewEventSchemaWithEffect>
/*
{
  type: "pageView",
  title: string,
  url: string,
  additionalInfo: Record<string, any> // Note that this is no more optional
}
*/
```

Equipped with the knowledge of `ZodSchema`, `ZodEffects` and `infer`, let's try
to solve the problem at hand:

## Attempt 1

In `const listener = (schema, handler) => {/*...*/}`, we can start typing as
follows:

- Let's assume that the type `T` is the type we are defining schema for
- Then, `schema` is of type `ZodSchema<T>` or `ZodEffects<T>`
- `handler` is a function taking an input `T` to `Promise<boolean>`

```typescript
import { ZodSchema, ZodEffects } from "zod";

type HandlerFunction<T> = (input: T) => Promise<boolean>

const listener = <T>(schema: ZodSchema<T>|ZodEffects<T>, handler:
HandlerFunction<T>) => {}
```

Here is a problem - `ZodEffects<T>` does not accept any `T`. `T` must be a
subtype of `ZodTypeAny`.

```typescript
import { ZodSchema, ZodEffects, ZodTypeAny } from "zod";

type HandlerFunction<T> = (input: T) => Promise<boolean>

const listener = <T extends ZodTypeAny>(schema: ZodSchema<T>|ZodEffects<T>,
handler: HandlerFunction<T>) => {}
```

With this setup, we can experiment with the following:

- Keep `async message => true` as the second argument. Note that we need
`async` as `HandlerFunction` is expected to return a `Promise`
- Try to pass in `pageViewEventSchema` as the first argument, TS complains that
it does not satisfy `ZodTypeAny`
- Try to pass in  `pageViewEventSchemaWithEffect` as the first argument, TS
does not error out. But `message` is not the plain type
`PageViewEventWithEffect`!

We can go down the path of exploring `zod` internal types to get our work done.
But there is a good way out by changing our assumption of what `T` should be by
taking the key fact that `z.infer` accepts both `ZodObject` and `ZodEffects`.
Let's try that once.

## Attempt 2

In `const listener = (schema, handler) => {/*...*/}`, we type as follows:

- Let's assume that the type `T` is the type of the Zod schema
- Then, `schema` is of type T
- `handler` is a function taking an input `z.infer<T>` to `Promise<boolean>`

Let's try to implement it:

```typescript
type HandlerFunction<T> = (input: T) => Promise<boolean>

const listener = <T>(schema: T, handler: HandlerFunction<z.infer<T>>) => {}
```

There is a slight problem with this, as `infer` does not work with any `T`, but
with only `ZodType`s (we get a good TS error explaining this, so we can adapt).

```typescript
type HandlerFunction<T> = (input: T) => Promise<boolean>

const listener = <T extends ZodType>(schema: T, handler:
HandlerFunction<z.infer<T>>) => {}
```

Now, TS is all fine. Let's experiment with the same cases as the previous
attempt.

- Keep `async message => true` as the second argument. Note that we need
`async` as `HandlerFunction` is expected to return a `Promise`
- Try to pass in `pageViewEventSchema` as the first argument. There is no error
and we can see that the type of the `message` is the same as `PageViewEvent`,
we get nice autocompletion!
- Try to pass in  `pageViewEventSchemaWithEffect` as the first argument. There
is no error and we can see that the type of the `message` is the same as
`PageViewEventWithEffect`

So, all the test cases passed. We can go a further step ahead and make sure
that the `listener` function does not take an invalid `schema` and `handler`
combination as the input - it must be a TS error.

```typescript
const handler = async (message: PageViewEventWithEffect) => true

listener(pageViewEventSchema, handler)
```

There is a TS error now, which reads in the end that `Types of property
'additionalInfo' are incompatible.`, which is indeed the case.

Thus, we have finally solved the `listener` matching the `schema` and `handler`
types. Let's take a zoomed-out picture of this and recap what we have learnt
the way.

## Learnings

TS generics is a powerful tool - it can make your life easy or hard depending
on how to use it. Choosing a generic parameter to parametrize the function when
the parameters are interdependent is hard - even if making `T` the simple type
that directly corresponds to the object that we wanted to work with was
intuitive, it made the problem of deriving the type for another parameter
harder. With the utility to convert zod schema to a plain type, we were able to
solve the problem easily. Thus, it is always worth thinking about solving a
problem from multiple directions!

## How does it help to remove the type boilerplate?!!

In the example that we have seen above, we extracted lots of types and
sprinkled them everywhere to understand the problem on a deep level. Let's see
how we can get rid of all the boilerplate and arrive at a much cleaner code.

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

// Library
const queue = {
  // Dummy queue
  subscribe: (handler: (message: string) => Promise<void>) => {}
};

type HandlerFunction<T> = (input: T) => Promise<boolean>;

const listener = <T extends z.ZodType>(
  schema: T,
  handler: HandlerFunction<z.infer<T>>
) => {
  queue.subscribe(async (message) => {
    try {
      const messageData = JSON.parse(message);
      const parsedMessage = schema.parse(messageData);
      const result = await handler(parsedMessage);
      if (!result) {
        console.error("Handler returned false");
      }
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e);
    }
  });
};

// Application code
const pageViewEventSchema = z.object({
  type: z.literal("pageView"),
  title: z.string().min(1),
  url: z.string().min(1),
  additionalInfo: z.optional(z.record(z.string(), z.any()))
});

listener(pageViewEventSchema, async (event) => {
  console.log("Got pageView event")
  console.log(event.title)
  console.log(event.url)
  console.log(event.additionalInfo)
  return true
})
```

While our library code here does pretty much type-lifting, our application code
is a plain JS code with the added benefits of type checking - who doesn't want
it at no cost? If you want to type this code manually, it will be very much
ugly as we need to provide a `zod` type as a generic argument `T`.
