  - I came across a use case where creating an object required heavy computation
  in all of its keys, but all of them were not accessed, based on the conditions
  - This wasted the computation, which would have been carried out lazily
  - I created a function `lazy` in TypeScript to do Lazy Evaluation and Result
  Caching, using `Proxy`
  - The input object to the `lazy` function has functions as its values, which
  would be called `Proxy`
  -  Function `lazy` provides a strongly typed interface, thus, not allowing
  invalid inputs
  - `lazy` is a convenience wrapper, which does not require the user function to
  be changed

Recently, I came across a use case in TypeScript where the properties of an
object were expensive to calculate, and they were not used that frequently. In
summary, the function looked like this:

```typescript
const doHeavyComputation = (args) => {
  // do something with args
  return value
}

const aFunctionReturningObject = () => {
  // Do some preparation
  return {
    property1: doHeavyComputation(args1),
    property2: doHeavyComputation(args2),
    // other properties
  }
}
```

And, its usage looked somewhat like this

```typescript
const user = () => {
  const returnedObject = aFunctionReturningObject()
  if (returnedObject.property1 === someValue) {
    // do Something with that value
    return
  } else if (
    returnedObject.property2 === otherValue ||
    returnedObject.property3
  ) {
    // do some other computation
    return
  }
}
```

As you can see, calculating `property2` and `property3` is unnecessary if the
`property1` equals `someValue`. However, we know this only at the time of
usage, which does not help us in any way to optimize during the computation. In
this short article, let's see how we can approach this problem with the
constraints of:

- Doing minimal modifications at the computation side
(`aFunctionReturningObject`)
- Doing **no** modification at the site of usage
- Keeping the usages type-safe and syntactically clean (ideally, same as what
we have written earlier)

## Become Lazy

Turns out that this problem is pretty common in Computer Science and its
solution is called **[Lazy
Evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation#:~:text=In%20programming%20language%20theory%2C%20lazy,avoids%20repeated%20evaluations%20(sharing).)**.
Lazy Evaluation is the method of evaluating an expression at the site of its
usage, rather than the declaration. In our function `aFunctionReturningObject`,
we are calculating `property1`, `property2`, ... during its declaration. With
lazy evaluation in place, they would be calculated when they are used (Here, in
`user`, during `returnedObject.property1`).

While Haskell uses Lazy Evaluation by default, and some languages like Kotlin
and Scala provide the `lazy` keyword to achieve the same, we don't have such an
option in JS. However, instead of _returning a value_, if we _return a function
that returns the value_, the value would not get calculated until the function
is called. In our case, it would look something like this:

```typescript
const aFunctionReturningObject = () => {
  // Do some preparation
  return {
    property1: () => doHeavyComputation(args1),
    property2: () => doHeavyComputation(args2),
    // other properties
  }
}

const user = () => {
  const returnedObject = aFunctionReturningObject()
  if (returnedObject.property1() === someValue) {
    // do Something with that value
    return
  } else if (
    returnedObject.property2() === otherValue ||
    returnedObject.property3()
  ) {
    // do some other computation
    return
  }
}
```

However, this solution has a few problems:

- The property access is now a function call, which requires modifications at
the user side
- Evaluating the same property twice, would require evaluating
`doHeavyComputation()` twice, which might not be ideal if the heavy computation
is returning the same values every time

## Lazy Pro

Let's address these problems by writing a function `lazy`, that would take in
an object with values in the format `() => any`, and make the property access a
regular one instead of a function call. It will also take care of caching the
evaluations.

To address the cases of intercepting the property access of an object and
redefining its behavior, JS provides a mechanism named
[Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy).
We can wrap our original object with the proxy, along with handlers to redefine
its behavior. Let's look into the implementation of `lazy` using `Proxy`.

```typescript
const lazy = <T extends {}>(object: T) => {
  const cache = {} as T
  return new Proxy(object, {
    get(target, prop) {
      const key = prop as keyof T
      if (!(key in cache)) {
        const value = target[key]
        cache[key] = value ? value() : undefined
      }
      return cache[key]
    },
  })
}
```

The logic is straightforward albeit with an error:

- We take in a type `T` that extends `{}`, as Proxy requires an object as its
input
- In `Proxy`, we intercept the `get` method, which corresponds to all property
accesses
- The `get` method takes `target` (in our case, same as `object`) and the
`prop`, the property being accessed as parameters
- `prop` can be any `string | symbol`, we cast it to `keyof T` as `key`.
- We check if `key` is the `cache`, if it isn't, we access it from `target`,
check if it is not undefined, and evaluate it
- Finally, we return `cache[key]`

TS screams us with an error that we can not use `value()`, as it is `unknown`.
This is true, as we don't know the values of the type `{}` in advance. We need
to restrict ourselves to a subtype of `{}`, that has `() => any` as values.

```typescript
type LazyInput = {
  [Key: string]: () => any
}
```

Then, we can modify the signature of `lazy` as,

```typescript
const lazy = <T extends LazyInput>(object: T) => {
  // same as before
}
```

Cool! the `lazy` function is free of type errors now. Let's check it in action.
Before that, to check if caching is working, let's define a `logAndReturn`
function that does exactly what it is named :smile:

```typescript
const logAndReturn = <T>(value: T) => {
  console.log("Logging", value)
  return value
}
```

Then, let's prepare input for `lazy`

```typescript
const input = {
  intValue: () => logAndReturn(2),
  stringValue: () => logAndReturn("string")
}
```

Let's call `lazy` now!

```typescript
const lazyOutput = lazy(input)
```

Let's log its values

```typescript
console.log(lazyOutput.intValue) // "Logging 2", 2
console.log(lazyOutput.intValue) // 2
console.log(lazyOutput.intValue) // 2
console.log(lazyOutput.stringValue) // "Logging string", string
console.log(lazyOutput.stringValue) // string
```

The log looks nice, on the first property access, it called `logAndReturn` and
subsequent accesses used the value from the cache. However, most of the use
cases would not be to log the value, rather than to use it. Let's try that as
well:

```typescript
const addOne = (x: number) => x + 1
const addPrefix = (prefix: string, value: string) =>
  `${prefix}${value}`

const intResult = addOne(lazyOutput.intValue)
const stringResult = addPrefix(
  "result:",
  lazyOutput.stringValue
)

console.log({ intResult, stringResult })
```

Ah, now we see an error in calls to `addOne`!

```
Argument of type '() => number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
Argument of type '() => string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
```

It turns out that the type of `lazyOutput` is still

```typescript
type LazyOutput = typeof lazyOutput
/*
type LazyOutput = {
    intValue: () => number;
    stringValue: () => string;
}
*/
```

with the values being functions. But, we want their return types instead! We
can fix that by creating a type `Lazy<T>`

```typescript
type Lazy<T extends LazyInput> = {
  [Key in keyof T]: ReturnType<T[Key]>
}
```

Note that `ReturnType` is a TS inbuilt type, that returns the return type of a
function. Now, we modify the `lazy` function as:

```typescript
const lazy = <T extends LazyInput>(object: T) => {
  const cache = {} as T
  return new Proxy(object, {
    // same as before
  }) as Lazy<T>
}
```

With this, the errors in the call of `addOne` are now gone, and the logic in
the type domain matches that of the execution domain. The `LazyOutput` type is
now,

```typescript
type LazyOutput = typeof lazyOutput
/*
type LazyOutput = {
    intValue: number;
    stringValue: string;
}
*/
```

Which is what we expected. Now, we can return to our initial example and can
rewrite it as:

```typescript
const aFunctionReturningObject = () => {
  // Do some preparation
  return lazy({
    property1: () => doHeavyComputation(args1),
    property2: () => doHeavyComputation(args2),
    // other properties
  })
}

const user = () => {
  const returnedObject = aFunctionReturningObject()
  if (returnedObject.property1 === someValue) {
    // do Something with that value
    return
  } else if (
    returnedObject.property2 === otherValue ||
    returnedObject.property3
  ) {
    // do some other computation
    return
  }
}
```

In this code, we wrapped the return value with `lazy` and deferred the
computations of the values by putting them inside a function. The `lazy`
function did not require us to change the `user` function at all, which is very
good, as we don't know from how many places `aFunctionReturningObject` would be
called, especially if it is in a library.

## Try it Yourself!

[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/little-grass-8qbn70). Feel free to fork
it out and play with it.

## Lazy Pro Max

Some of you might object to the key naming in the argument of `lazy`. Since we
now have a function as a value, it would be rather good to name `property1` as
`getProperty1`, which would make things more clear. We can hand off the
responsibility of key renaming to `Proxy`, which would convert the access of
`property1` to `getProperty1` call.

This is a valid objection. However, implementing these rules out that _Lazy is
Easy_, thus, I will cover it in another article _Lazy is Hard_ :sweat_smile:.
