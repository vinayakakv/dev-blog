I was working with computers from an early age.
My memory of drawing mountains in `mspaint.exe` in Windows 98 is still vivid.
I remember my joy of successfully installing Windows XP, and, waiting for months to download 6GB Mac OS X Snow Leopard and build a Hackintosh :grinning_face_with_star_eyes:.

I was introduced to programming with [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) and [LOGO](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo*(programming_language)>) and found them to be enjoyable. My real application-oriented programming started on the Hackintosh with me writing C programs to verify my Math homework :sweat_smile:! Later on, I learned many programming languages, thanks to nice IDEs and code suggestion support! Nowadays, I'm comfortable with many programming languages, since they share common ideologies.

During my formal CS education at [SJCE](https://sjce.ac.in/) and [NITK](https://www.nitk.ac.in/), I was working on several projects ranging from Client-Sever Systems, P2P Systems, and Deep Learning. You can check some of them in my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/vinayakakv)!
I'm in software industry for sometime now and focus on all aspects of building software -- including design, architecture, development, deployment and testing. I'm also comfortable with all verticals of the software stack.

Apart from programming, [I also hunt mountains, do photography and write about nature! â†’](https://vinayakakv.substack.com)
