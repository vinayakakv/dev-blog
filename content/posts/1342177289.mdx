description: The day when we received a 1GB message on our RabbitMQ (did we?) and how we handled it
date: '2024-09-14'
tldr: |
  - We encountered a service downtime due to hiccups while publishing messages to RabbitMQ
  - On inspecting logs, we encountered connection closures, with an error saying it received a packet of size 1342177289 bytes, which is more than a GB
  - Since the message of that size is highly unlikely AND the same number had appeared multiple times in the log, we wondered if that number has any special meaning
  - A quick Google search revealed that this number came from `AMQP0091` string in the initialization packet, which is never supposed to be sent on an initialized connection
  - We found out a race condition existed on our retry logic and had to fix it
  - Along with this, we observed this MQ publishing is significantly taking more resources than expected.
  - We handle the situation temporarily by adding `HorizontalPodAutoScalar`, while we investigate the issue further

## A Good Morning

One fine day, we woke up to a page at 7AM that one of our non-critical services are returning more 500s than the usual. In fact, 500s constituted more than 50% of the responses, and that's why we were paged. This service ran smoothly for more than a month now, and we had just enabled message publishing in that service last evening. Suspecting this would be the cause, we quickly disabled the functionality by turning a feature flag off and the 500s gradually came down until the alert automatically turned itself off.

Once we were completely awake and caffeinated, we started looking into the logs of the service and a few things stood out:

1. The entries with `level=ERROR` had a spike in the duration of increased 500s. The errors were 502 actually, since the service was quite unavailable during that time.
2. Those log entries were specifically coming from the MQ client - we use self-hosted RabbitMQ
3. The logs were repeatedly saying
   - MQ sending us `ECONNRESET`
   - Our connection retry mechanism kicking in, and becoming successful sometimes, failing other times
   - A seemingly crpyic error message - `connection closed: FRAME_ERROR - type 65, all octets = <<>>: {frame_too_large,1342177289,4088} (501)`

Our service is written in NodeJS + TS, and we use [`@cloudamqp/amqp-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudamqp/amqp-client) to communicate with MQ. We subscribe to [`AMQPChannel`](https://cloudamqp.github.io/amqp-client.js/classes/AMQPChannel)'s [`onError`](https://cloudamqp.github.io/amqp-client.js/classes/AMQPChannel.html#onerror) method to kick in our connection retry mechanism. Our retry mechanism is quite raw and simple and does not take of messages that would be sent during the retry window - they would be lost. The retry mechanism keeps track of a counter, and backs off exponentially. Once the retry is successful, the counter is reset and everything is back normal.

While the retry mechanism seemed to work fine in this case (**\*spoiler**: it wasn't\*), which we were happy about, the number `1342177289` worried us. We have configured the maximum message size as `4088` bytes, which is more than sufficient in almost all the cases. What we were seeing instead was a message of around 1GB, which would be close to impossible! I joked that I'm 99.99% confident that 1GB message would not be the case, but left the remaining probability for me to be amused.

We scoured the logs of the service and its historical data and nothing could come to as close as a GB, or even a few 100KBs. Turning back to logs, We noticed that same number `1342177289` was repeated multiple times. It is highly improbable that we get multiple 1GB ish messages with the same byte count - we never retry publishes as well.

Having gone through articles of magic numbers appearing during crashes, I became particularly interested in the number `1342177289` - would it be the case it was a legit packet size and _somehow_ one or more bits got corrupted to become this humongous big number? I started looking into the bits then:

```
0101 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1001
```

Weird - there are more zeros than ones - yes. But 2 bits at Most Significant side should not haven been set accidentally. Meanwhile, we have pasted the number into Google and [it only brought up results **ONLY** related to RabbitMQ!](https://www.google.com/search?q=1342177289)

## What had happened?

[John Eckersberg makes a good job at explaning what this number means](https://john.eckersberg.com/debugging-rabbitmq-frame_too_large-error.html). To make sense of this number, we need to include `type 65` into the picture as well -- `65` is ASCII `A`. Then there is channel number `19793`, which was not included in this log. These three numbers combined together makes out the string `AMQP` followed by the numbers `009`. For reference, the AMQP init packet expects `AMQP0091` in the header (`0091` being the version and represented as a raw number). We can see parts of it in our number:

```bash
1342177289
= 0101 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1001
= 0x50 0x00 0x00 0x09
= "P" 0 0 9
```

This means that we were sending initialization packet after the connection was initialized. For reference, here is how our retry looked like:

```ts
class MqClient {
  private readonly client: AMQPClient
  // We keep a single connection
  private readonly connection: AMQPConnection | null = null
  private retryCount = 0

  public MqClient(url: string) {
    this.client = new AMQPClient(url)
  }

  // Users SHOULD call this
  public async init() {
    this.connection = await client.connection()
    this.connection.onEror(this.retry)
    this.retryCount = 0
  }

  private async retry() {
    this.retryCount += 1
    // Exponential backoff
    await sleep(2 ** this.retryCount * 1000 /*ms*/)
    await this.init()
  }
}
```

While this code looks good at the surface, **if an error happens during retry, since the retry handler is already registered, it is called again - now multiple retry sequence are running concurrently**. And it is entirely possible that a retry happens on already initialized connection - and that's what has happened.

## The Fix

The fix is simple, clear connection and associated handlers before attempting a retry. This is akin how React's `useEffect` wants us to [clean up all the subscriptions, callbacks etc when the component is unmounting](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development).

However, that's not the end of the story. We observed that MQ connections were being closed when the traffic to our service was mere 20% more than usual. We were running 3 pods in Kubernetes and observed our pods were running over limit on CPU utilization. Scaling them to 16 did bring things back to normal at 100% CPU utilization. We need to further investigate why an act of publishing the message uses up the resources so much. Until then, we plan to use [`HorizontalPodScalar`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) on CPU utilization to scale up the service on load.
