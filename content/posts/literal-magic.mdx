description: "How I solved typing object key mapping  in TypeScript"

tldr: |
  - I came across a problem recently where I had to _type_ the conversion of
  object keys from `camelCase` to `snake_case`  in TypeScript.
  
  - While implementing the utilities is an easy task, making them contain type
  information was crucial.
  
  - Using TypeScript's template literal string and pattern matching, first, I
  defined a type to convert strings from `camelCase` to `snake_case`.
  
  - By mapping through keys of the object, and converting them to `snake_case`
  using the utility defined earlier, I was able to convert the keys of the object
  type.
  
  - Adding type annotations required a similar kind of computation, except that
  it was on types. I wondered if we can reduce the double computation, anyway it
  is not possible since the type computations exist only during compile time
  :sweat_smile:

The variable naming conventions differ across tools and programming languages.
While the database column names mostly use `snake_case`, the APIs and data
models prefer to use `camelCase`. Most of the ORMs such as Hibernate and
TypeORM do this conversion automatically, making the process seamless. However,
I recently came across a use case in TypeScript where this conversion was
manual, we had to retain the type information.

>  **The problem**: Given an object having the keys in `camelCase` format,
convert them to `snake_case` **retaining Type Information after the
conversion**. 

While it is easy to convert a string to `snake_case`, retaining the type
information is the key here. Let's start with a simple, recursive (you will
know in a short while why we are doing recursion :smile:) function to convert a
string from `camelCase` to  `snake_case`.

```typescript
const isUpperCase = (str: string) => str === str.toUpperCase()

const stringToSnakeCase = (str: string): string => {
  const [first, ...rest] = str
  const restString = rest.join("")
  return str
    ? isUpperCase(first)
      ? `_${first.toLowerCase()}${stringToSnakeCase(
          restString
        )}`
      : `${first}${stringToSnakeCase(restString)}`
    : str
}

```

The function is pretty simple:

- First, we destruct the string into `first` and `restString` (`rest` is an
array, we join it to get the string)
- If the first character is an upper case character, we insert `_` in the
beginning, convert it into lower case and proceed to convert the rest of the
string. 
- Otherwise, we keep the first letter as it is, and convert the rest of the
string. 
- At the end, the string would be empty, and we return it.

> **Note**: We have to manually add the return type to the function as
`string`, since [TS can not infer return types of the recursions
yet](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/3336).

Using this function, we can write a function to convert the keys of an object
to `snake_case` recursively.

```typescript
type Value = object | string | number | boolean

const _snakify = (obj: Value): Value =>
  typeof obj === "object"
    ? Object.fromEntries(
        Object.entries(obj).map(([key, value]) => [
          stringToSnakeCase(key),
          _snakify(value),
        ])
      )
    : obj
```

Let's add a wrapper to this function to take in and return an `object`.

```typescript
const snakify = (obj: object): object => _snakify(obj)
```

To test this function, we declare a constant value and check if the function
converts its keys to the snake case correctly.

```typescript
const obj = {
  hiWorld: 2,
  helloWorld: {
    hiTest: "test",
    hiTestTwo: {
      threeFour: false,
    },
  },
}

const snakified = snakify(obj)

console.log(snakified)
```

The output is,

```typescript
{
  hi_world: 2,
  hello_world: { hi_test: "test", hi_test_two: { three_four: false } }
}
```

This looks fantastic. However, if we want to access any property of the
`snakified`, TypeScript gives us an error, as it had become the plain `object`.

## Adding Types

Now it is the fun part -- we want to add types to the `snakifyObject` function
to retain the information about the keys. In the end, we should be able to
access `snakifiedObject.hi_world`, for example, with no errors.

To begin with, let's define a `type` to convert a `string` to `snake_case`. 

```typescript
type StringToSnakeCase<Str extends string> =
  Str extends `${infer First}${infer Rest}`
    ? First extends Uppercase<First>
      ? `_${Lowercase<First>}${StringToSnakeCase<Rest>}`
      : `${First}${StringToSnakeCase<Rest>}`
    : Str

```

This type definition looks similar to the definition of our `stringToSnakeCase`
function, pretty much the same thing is happening here but at the type level.
Let's break it down:

- First, we destruct the string type `T` into `First` and `Rest` using string
literal syntax and `infer` keyword.
-  TypeScript resolves `First` to be a character and `Rest` to be a string
(btw, both are type `string` in TypeScript).
-  Then, we do conditional to check if `First` is uppercase, and add `_` to the
string based on that.
-  If such destruction can not happen (when `Str` is empty), we return `Str`
itself.

Now, we can use this type as,

```typescript
type Test1 = StringToSnakeCase<"helloWorld"> 
// type Test1 = "hello_world"

type Test2 = StringToSnakeCase<"LongListOfWords"> 
// type Test2 == "_long_list_of_words"

type Test3 = StringToSnakeCase<3.21>
// Error: Type 'number' does not satisfy the constraint 'string'
```

We can proceed to define the type `Snakify<T>` to convert the keys of the
object to `snake_case`.

```typescript
type Snakify<T> = T extends object
  ? {
      [K in keyof T as StringToSnakeCase<
        K & string
      >]: Snakify<T[K]>
    }
  : T
```

Here, we check if `T` is a subtype of `object` -- if it is, we map its `string`
keys using `StringToSnakeCase`, and recursively `Snakify` its values; else, we
return the type `T` itself (this will happen at the end of recursion).

Using this type, we can now annotate `snakify` function as,

```typescript
const snakifyObject = <T extends object>(obj: T) =>
  _snakify(obj) as Snakify<T>

```

Now, the return types of the `snakified` object in the above example are
inferred correctly as :tada:

```typescript
type Result = typeof snakified
/*
type Result = {
    hi_world: number;
    hello_world: {
        hi_test: string;
        hi_test_two: {
            three_four: boolean;
        };
    };
}
*/
```

## Caveats

If there is an `_` already present in the key, `isUpperCase()` in the code and
`T extends UpperCase<T>` test in the type will pass and we get another `_`. For
example,

```typescript
const obj = {
    hiWorld: 2,
    hi_world: "Hello"
}

const snakified = snakify(obj)

type Result = typeof snakified
/*
type Result = {
    hi_world: number;
    hi__world: string;
}
*/

console.log(snakified)
```

The output would be,

```typescript
{ hi_world: 2, hi__world: "Hello" }
```

While we can fix the code by updating `isUpperCase` function as,

```typescript
const isUpperCase = (str: string) =>
  str === str.toUpperCase() &&
  str !== str.toLocaleLowerCase()
```

to fix the type, first, we need to define a type `IsAlpha<T>` returning `T` if
`T` is an alphabet. We can do this as,

```typescript
type IsAlpha<T extends string> = T extends Uppercase<T> &
  Lowercase<T>
  ? never
  : T
```

The key point here is that, for a non-alphabet, its uppercase and lowercase
would be equal to itself, returning the `never` type. Now, we can add this chek
to `StringToSnakeCase` type as,

```typescript
type StringToSnakeCase<T extends string> =
  T extends `${infer First}${infer Rest}`
    ? First extends IsAlpha<First> & Uppercase<First>
      ? `_${Lowercase<First>}${StringToSnakeCase<Rest>}`
      : `${First}${StringToSnakeCase<Rest>}`
    : T

```

Then, the `type Result` would be equal to,

```typescript
type Result = {
    hi_world: string | number;
}
```

which fixes the issue.

## Conclusion and Thoughts

I never thought that TypeScript's string literal types and pattern matching are
useful in real-world scenarios until I came across this use-case :sweat_smile:.
They are undoubtedly powerful type tools in the TypeScript programmer's
arsenal. In a similar spirit to this use case, we can write utilities and
associated types to convert strings across various conventions.

One thing I really thought about was code-duplication. Across this example, we
wrote similar logic both in code and type, achieving the same things. Since the
type information does not exist at all during runtime, unfortunately, this
seems to be the only way. I'm really curious about how problems similar to
this, that involve type manipulation and mapping are handled in other
programming languages; please let me know if you come across such situations
before!
