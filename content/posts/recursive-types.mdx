TypeScript has a very solid type system that makes few things possible, which
are not possible in other typed languages. To show the powers of TS type
system, we will go through a practical problem in this post and sprinkle types
to it to make it robust.

## The Problem

APIs and Databases normally use differnet styles of naming variables. While API
fields are `camelCase` most of the times, in DB, we often name columns in
`snake_case` often. 

Snake case names in DB are reasonable, as SQL is case-insensitvive. A variable
in camelcase, say, `jsonPayload` is converted to `jsonpayload` unless quoted.
Quoting is often inconvinent and often missed when working in a SQL console
directly.

While ORMs can be configured to handle these conversions in majority of the
cases, when we need to deal with db directly, we need to handle case
conversion. The problem is to handle the conversion in a type-safe way. We will
solidify our expectations soon.

## The Beginnings 

Let's start with a JS function to convert camel case strings to snake case, and
iteratively add features later on. Converting a camel case string to snake case
is easy -- we iterate through the characters of the word, if we find an
uppercase letter, we emit an underscore (`_`) and the corresponding uppercase
letter. Otherwise, we will just emit the current letter. Let's assume that word
does not contain any special characters (it makes sense, as we can't use
special characters while naming identifiers and DB columns).

```javascript
const isUpperCase = (letter) =>
  letter === letter.toUpperCase()

const toSnakeCase = (word) =>
  word
    .split("")
    .map((letter) =>
      isUpperCase(letter)
        ? ["_", letter.toLowerCase()]
        : [letter],
    )
    .flat()
    .join("")

const result1 = toSnakeCase("helloWorld") // "hello_world"
const result2 = toSnakeCase("helloWorldTest") // "hello_world_test"
```

That was simple. Let's write a function to convert keys of an object to snake
case while perserving the values as-is. Think of the input object as whatever
we got in API body, and the output as what we want to write to DB.

```javascript
const convertKeysToSnakeCase = (object) =>
  Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(object).map(([key, value]) => [
      toSnakeCase(key),
      value,
    ]),
  )

const result = convertKeysToSnakeCase({
  apiVersion: "2023-02",
  jsonPayload: "{hello: 2}",
})
// { api_version: "2023-02", json_payload: "{hello: 2}" }
```

## Sprinkle some Types!

Let's start by tyoing adding types to `isUpperCase` and `toSnakeCase` functions

```typescript
const isUpperCase = (letter: string) =>
  letter === letter.toUpperCase()

const toSnakeCase = (word: string) =>
  word
    .split("")
    .map((letter) =>
      isUpperCase(letter)
        ? ["_", letter.toLowerCase()]
        : [letter],
    )
    .flat()
    .join("")
```

Note that the return types are infered as `string` in both the cases, so we
don't need to type it explicitly. Type Inference is a powerful tool in TS which
eliminates the need of type annotation in most of the cases. I have explored a
few examples in [my last post](/blog/type-inference), go check it out too!

Now, it is time to type `convertKeysToSnakeCase` too. We can start as:

```typescript
const convertKeysToSnakeCase = (object: object) =>
  Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(object).map(([key, value]) => [
      toSnakeCase(key),
      value,
    ]),
  )
```

Typing `object` param as `object` (sorry for the repitition!) makes sense, and
output type is infered as `{[k: string]: any}`, which is an object with only
string keys.

## Setting Expectations

When we pass an object through `convertKeysToSnakeCase`, we lose all type
information and we can index the result with any key. Ideally, the keys should
get converted to snake case in type and all other key accesses should result in
type error. Put it in code,

```typescript
const result = convertKeysToSnakeCase({
  apiVersion: "2023-02",
  jsonPayload: "{hello: 2}",
})
result.abc // Should result in a type error saying that the key does not exist
result.json_payload // Should be no error, type should be string
result.jsonPayload // Should result in a type error saying that the key does
not exist
```

With the expectations set, we can move on to solving the problem. The solution
is exactly as [Literal Magic](/blog/literal-magic), but presented in a
differnet way.

## Enter Generics

We want a type `ConvertKeysToSnakeCase` which accpets a generic type `T` which
should be an object, and convert its keys to snake case. Let's start by
ensuring that the type only accepts objects as input:

```typescript
type ConvertKeysToSnakeCase<T extends object> = T

type Result1 = ConvertKeysToSnakeCase<42> // Error
type Result2 = ConvertKeysToSnakeCase<{
  apiVersion: string
  jsonPayload: string
}> // Success
```

We added a generic _constraint_ that `T` should be a subtype of `object`, which
is making sure that we don't accidentally pass in other types. Now, somehow, we
have to loop over the keys of the object and transform them into snake case.
Let's assume that there is a helper `ToSnakeCase` to convert individual keys to
snake case.

```typescript
type ToSnakeCase<T extends string> = T // It does nothing now

type ConvertKeysToSnakeCase<T extends object> = {
  [Key in keyof T as ToSnakeCase<
    Key & string
  >]: T[Key]
}
```

In `Key in keyof T as ToSnakeCase<Key & string>`, we are looping over all keys
of T (got by `keyof T`), with indivual key as `Key`. Then, we are mapping it
using `as` keyword to `ToSnakeCase<Key>`. We need `Key & string` in the
argument as key of an object may be `string | number | symbol`, and we want
eliminate `number | symbol` from the loop. 

Now, let's move to the fun part of implementing `ToSnakeCase` itself!

## Hi Recursion!

To implement the type `ToSnakeCase<T extends string>`, we can't iterate over
indivual items of `string` unfortunately as we did in `toSnakeCase` function
(However, TS supports iterating over the keys of an object using `keyof` as we
just saw). TS supports recursion with template literal types. Before going to
TS, let's try solving the problem in JS recursively.

```typescript
const isUpperCase = (letter: string) =>
  letter === letter.toUpperCase()

const toSnakeCase = (word: string): string => {
  const [first, ...rest] = word
  if (!first) return "" // Base case
  const restString = rest.join("")
  return isUpperCase(first)
    ? `_${first.toLowerCase()}${toSnakeCase(
        restString,
      )}`
    : `${first}${toSnakeCase(restString)}`
}

const result1 = toSnakeCase("helloWorld") // "hello_world"
```

Let's break down how this is working:

- We first split the `word` into `first` and `rest`, where `first` is `string |
undefined`, and `rest` is `string[]`using [JS spread
syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)
- `first` will be `undefined` whenever `word=""`, so we return `""` in that
case (by equality, we could have returned `first` too, but returning `""` gives
clarity to the reader)
- We convert `rest` to a string to prepare it to be called recursively
- We check if `first` is an uppercase, similar to iterative case. If it is the
case then emit an underscore and corresponding lowercase letter; otherwise, we
don't change `first`
- We append the result of the recursion to the first character using [JS
Template
Strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).

Note that:

- We had to explicitly type the return value of `toSnakeCase` as `string` as TS
infered `any` as the return type of recursive function
- While this code works fine in native JS, in order for it to work in TS, we
need to set `"downlevelIteration": true`

Splitting an iterable to its _head_ and _body_ is a common operation in many
functional programming languages, which enables an operation on _head_ and
recursion on _body_. Fortunately, TS provides such functionality too, which we
can leverage. Let's explore the functionality:

```typescript
type ListComponents<T> = T extends [
  infer First,
  ...infer Rest,
]
  ? { head: First; body: Rest }
  : never

type StringComponents<T> =
  T extends `${infer First}${infer Rest}`
    ? { head: First; body: Rest }
    : never

type ListResult1 = ListComponents<[]>
// type ListResult1 = never
type ListResult2 = ListComponents<[2]>
/*
type ListResult2 = {
    head: 2;
    body: [];
}
*/
type ListResult3 = ListComponents<[1, 2, 3, 4]>
/*
type ListResult3 = {
    head: 1;
    body: [2, 3, 4];
}
*/
type ListResult4 = ListComponents<"hello">
// type ListResult4 = never

type StringResult1 = StringComponents<"">
// type StringResult1 = never
type StringResult2 = StringComponents<"a">
/*
type StringResult2 = {
    head: "a";
    body: "";
}
*/
type StringResult3 = StringComponents<"abc">
/*
type StringResult3 = {
    head: "a";
    body: "bc";
}
*/
type StringResult4 = StringComponents<["a", "b"]>
// type StringResult4 = never
```

TS is doing _Pattern Matching_ here - `[infer First, ...(infer Rest)]` and
`${infer First}${infer Rest}` are the patterns. If the input _matches_ the
pattern, the type variables `First` and `Rest` will get their respective
values. In the first pattern, we needed `...` to explicitly tell that `Rest`
should be an array. In second pattern, `Rest` is automatically resolved to rest
of the characters.

With the power of pattern matching in hand, we can easily convert the recursive
version of `toSnakeCase` into a type.

```typescript
type ToSnakeCase<T extends string> =
  T extends `${infer First}${infer Rest}`
    ? First extends Uppercase<First>
      ? `_${Lowercase<First>}${ToSnakeCase<Rest>}`
      : `${First}${ToSnakeCase<Rest>}`
    : T

type Result1 = ToSnakeCase<"helloWorldTest"> // hello_world_test
type Result2 = ToSnakeCase<"JsonPayload"> // _json_payload
```

This code looks very similar to the function code we have written, except that
it is working in _Type Domain_, meaning it does not do any runtime action. Note
that the `Uppercase` and `Lowercase` helpers are provided by TS. What if we
could have same code across Type Domain and runtime?! - well, providing a
runtime type system is not one of the TS goals.

With `ToSnakeCase` in our hand, we can revisit `ConvertKeysToSnakeCase` now.

```typescript
type ConvertKeysToSnakeCase<T extends object> = {
  [Key in keyof T as ToSnakeCase<
    Key & string
  >]: T[Key]
}

type ObjectResult = ConvertKeysToSnakeCase<{
  apiVersion: string
  jsonPayload: string
}>
/*
{
  api_version: string;
  json_payload: string;
}
*/
```

And there we are! Now we can add types to `convertKeysToSnakeCase` function

```typescript
const convertKeysToSnakeCase = <T extends object>(
  object: T,
) =>
  Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(object).map(([key, value]) => [
      toSnakeCase(key),
      value,
    ]),
  ) as ConvertKeysToSnakeCase<T>
```

With that,

```typescript
const result = convertKeysToSnakeCase({
  apiVersion: "2023-02",
  jsonPayload: "{hello: 2}",
})
result.abc // Error: Property 'abc' does not exist...
result.json_payload // Works
result.jsonPayload // Error: Property 'jsonPayload' does not exist...
```

And we have successfully achieved the expectations! Note that few edge cases
exist in our implementation, for a comprehensive treatment on this usecase,
please look into [my earlier post](/blog/literal-magic).

## More Recursion!

Having solved camel case to snake case conversion in both runtime and type
domain, let's do the same of reverse.

```typescript
// Iterative version
const toCamelCase = (snakeCaseString: string) =>
  snakeCaseString.replaceAll(/_./g, (match) =>
    match.at(1).toUpperCase(),
  )
```

Here, we find all underscores and the next character, and replace it with the
uppercase version of the next character.

> **Bug Alert**: Both `toSnakeCase` and `toCamelCase` miss a few edge cases.
Ideally, `toSnakeCase(toCamelCase(s)) === s` and  ` toCamelCase(toSnakeCase(s))
=== s`,  in both runtime and type domain, which is not the case here. I will
leave it as an exercise to the reader to fix them to handle the edge cases.

We can also achive the same thing in recursion:

```typescript
const capitalize = (word: string) => {
  const [first, ...rest] = word
  if (!first) return ""
  return `${first.toUpperCase()}${rest.join("")}`
}

const toCamelCase = (snakeCaseString: string) => {
  const [first, ...rest] = snakeCaseString
  if (!first) return ""
  const restString = rest.join("")
  return first === "_"
    ? capitalize(toCamelCase(restString))
    : `${first}${toCamelCase(restString)}`
}
```

The recursive version is similar to `toSnakeCase` w.r.t splitting and the base
case, but has a different logic during recursion.

Now, we can convert this to type domain.

```typescript
type ToCamelCase<T extends string> =
  T extends `${infer First}${infer Rest}`
    ? First extends "_"
      ? Capitalize<ToCamelCase<Rest>>
      : `${First}${ToCamelCase<Rest>}`
    : T
```

We can go one step forward and use TS pattern matching to our advantage:

```typescript
type ToCamelCase<T extends string> =
  T extends `${infer First}_${infer Rest}`
    ? `${First}${Capitalize<ToCamelCase<Rest>>}`
    : T
```

Here we added underscore to the pattern itself to simplify the recursive case.
Note the we can't to this type of pattern matching in JS
[_yet_](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching)!

## Concluding Remarks

Recursion is a powerful tool. It is the method of solving a chunk of a problem
at a time, and then repeating the same on one or more subproblems. Recursion
also helps to bring out the mathematical structure of the problem. While
recursion is generally not optimized in many procedural languages, they are
heavily optimized in functional languages and are fun to use!
