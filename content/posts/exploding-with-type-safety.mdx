tldr: |
  - We solve an interesting problem of _exploding_ an array property of an object.
  - The `explode` function takes in a object, and its key as the input. It
  returns an array where the keys and values are derived by concatenating every
  element of an array with rest of the properties of the input object
  - We implement the `explode` function in JS and define a goal of making it
  type-safe: it should not accept invalid arguments and should return a typed
  result
  - We use `keyof ` operator combined with _key remapping_ to make the arguments
  type-safe
  - We use a combination of `Omit` and `number` index to make return value typed
  - We test our approach by calling the function and verifying the correctness of
  both results and types

Suppose we have an object, and one of its fields an array. Taking every array
elements and adding the rest of the objects keys is _exploding_ the object
w.r.t that array element. For example, if we have an object `{university: "XYZ", batch: 2019, students: [{name: "Alice"}, {name: "Bob"}]}`, exploding it
w.r.t `students` results in `[{university: "XYZ", batch: 2019, name: "Alice"}, {university: "XYZ", batch: 2019, name: "Bob"}]`.

We can encounter the need for the explosion in many cases. For example, let's
have an e-commerce order object, where it contains the individual items in an
array. When we want to process individual items with the order details,
explosion is the suitable operation.

With understanding the _explode_ operation, let's proceed to define our goals
clearly w.r.t to the result and type-safety

## The Goals

- We want to have a function `explode(object, key)` which does the explosion
- The `key` not being present in `object` should result in type error
- The `key` not being array should result in type error
- The returned array must be appropriately typed

We are resorting to type errors in most of the cases as we can be confident
about the function inputs when we run the code inside our app. If we want to
ship this function in a library, we need to do runtime checks as well, as there
is a possibility of this code called in plain JS without any typechecking. In
this post, for the sake of breivity, We are omiting the runtime checks.

## Solution without Types

The problem of explosion is easy and straightforward - we extract the value at
the key, map over the array and add rest of the properties to every object in
it.

```javascript
const explode = (object, key) => {
  const { [key]: array, ...rest } = object
  return array.map((item) => ({
    ...item,
    ...rest,
  }))
}
```

## Moving to the Type Realm

Now, let's add the types to the `explode` function, starting with the basics to
match the JS schematics:

```typescript
const explode = (object: object, key: string) => {
  const { [key]: array, ...rest } = object
  return array.map((item) => ({
    ...item,
    ...rest,
  }))
}
```

TS yells us at about two problems here:

1. We don't know if the `key` is indeed a key of the `object`

2. By virtue of that, `array` has type `any`, which makes `item` implicitly
   `any`.

Let's first restrict `key` to be a valid key of `object`. Since our parameters
have dependency now, we need to make our function generic. If the generic
parameter is `T`, we can either mark `object` or `key` as `T`. For the reasons
that will become evident later, let's mark the `object` as `T`. With that,
let's also add generic _constraint_ on `T` to be a subtype of `object`.

```typescript
const explode = <T extends object>(object: T, key: keyof T) => {
  const { [key]: array, ...rest } = object
  return array.map((item) => ({
    ...item,
    ...rest,
  }))
}
```

With this, we restrict `key` to be a valid key of `T`, not any string. This
solves the problem #1. We still need to solve problem #2. Before doing that,
let's first restrict `key` to only the keys where value is an array.

## Hello, Key Mapping!

Let's first understand how `keyof T` looks like before filtering it:

```typescript
type UniversityRecord = {
  university: string
  batch: number
  students: { name: string }[]
}

type Keys = keyof UniversityRecord
// "university" | "batch" | "students"
```

Thus, `Keys` is a union of strings, and it does not recursively descend into
the object structure, which is as expected. Now, can we loop over the union?
**Unfortunately not**. To understand why, remember there is no _order_ in
unions - `a | b | c` as `b | c | a` and etc. To loop over the keys and filter
them out, we can use [_key
remapping_](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html#key-remapping-via-as)

```typescript
type ArrayKeys<T extends object> = keyof {
  [K in keyof T as T[K] extends any[] ? K : never]: unknown
}
```

There are so many things going on here even if the code is deceptivly small.
Let's break down the things happening here:

- We are looping over every key `K` in `keyof T` in a mapping context (inside
  `[]`). Remember that such loop was not possible with unions.
- We are remapping the key using `as` keyword. If we map the key to `never`, it
  will be excluded
- Remapping supports conditions too - we check if `T[K]` is an array. If so, we
  keep `K` as it is; otherwise, we will exclude it using `never`.

Using this type helper, we can now define `explode` function as:

```typescript
const explode = <T extends object>(object: T, key: ArrayKeys<T>) => {
  const { [key]: array, ...rest } = object
  return array.map((item) => ({
    ...item,
    ...rest,
  }))
}
```

Now, we have to solve one problem: TS _still_ does not know that `object[key]`
is an array. While we can do further type manipulations, we can use runtime
functions to solve this.

```typescript
const explode = <T extends object>(object: T, key: ArrayKeys<T>) => {
  const { [key]: array, ...rest } = object
  return Array.isArray(array) ? array.map((item) => ({ ...item, ...rest })) : []
}
```

By adding `Array.isArray`, the `array` is treated as `any[]`. TS defines
`isArray` as a [_type
predicate_](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates)
with the following declaration:

```typescript
function isArray(arg: any): arg is any[]
```

When `isArray` returns `true`, TS knows that the `arg` is `any[]`, so we can
access `map` and `item` is infered as `any`. Let's try our new function
definition to check if argument types work properly:

```typescript
const res1 = explode(
  {
    university: 'XYZ',
    batch: 2019,
    students: [{ name: 'Alice' }, { name: 'Bob' }],
  },
  'university'
) // type error

const res2 = explode(
  {
    university: 'XYZ',
    batch: 2019,
    students: [{ name: 'Alice' }, { name: 'Bob' }],
  },
  'students'
) // no error
```

Well, so far so good. But if we check the return type of `explode`, it is
`any[]`, which makes it less useful in practice. Let's solve that by adding a
return type to it.

## Enter Type Gymnastics

We have following information about `explode(object, key)`:

- It returns an array (well, TS is intelligent to know that already, as it
  infers `any[]` as the return type)
- Every element of the array is an object.
- The object is derived by concatenating two objects:
  1. `object` with `key` removed
  2. the type of elements of `object[key]`

With this information, we can write a type helper `Explode`:

```typescript
type Explode<T extends object, K extends keyof T> = T[K] extends any[]
  ? (Omit<T, K> & T[K][number])[]
  : never
```

Few interesting things are happening here:

- We constrint `K` to be `keyof T`, not `ArrayKeys<T>`. Using `ArrayKeys` here
  does not add any useful information as TS does not get to know `T[K]` is an
  array. Thus, we choose a simpler path.
- We do the check `T[K] extends any[]` again, due to the reason explained
  above. If it does not, we return `never`. This case _never_ happens if `K
extends ArrayKeys<T>`
- If the check passes, we _omit_ `K` from `T` and intersect with the
  constituent type of `T[K]`
- To get the constituent type of `T[K]`, we index it on `number`, as arrays are
  indexed based on number

Now, we can proceed to type the `explode` function completly:

```typescript
const explode = <T extends object, K extends ArrayKeys<T>>(
  object: T,
  key: K
) => {
  const { [key]: array, ...rest } = object
  return (
    Array.isArray(array)
      ? array.map((item) => ({
          ...item,
          ...rest,
        }))
      : []
  ) as Explode<T, K>
}
```

It looks little bit different from our above definition. Apart from the `as
Explode<T,K>` cast, we typed `key` with `K` where `K extends ArrayKeys<T>`.
Typing `key` as `ArrayKeys<T>` and passing `typeof key` to `Explode` will keep
the generic argument to `Explode` as `ArrayKeys<T>`, not the specific literal
type that is passed in `key`. With this, we can proceed to _explode_!

## Testing

Let's call `explode` few times to check if everything works well. For testing,
let's assume we have an e-commerce order object:

```typescript
const order = {
  type: 'Order',
  customer: {
    name: 'Alice',
    address: '123 st.',
  },
  items: [
    {
      id: '111',
      name: 'Long sleeve T Shirt',
      price: 15,
      currency: 'USD',
    },
    {
      id: '232',
      name: 'Jeans',
      price: 12,
      currency: 'USD',
    },
  ],
  offers: [
    {
      code: 'FIRST-CUSTOMER',
      discountPercentage: '20',
    },
    {
      code: 'REFFERAL',
      discountPercentage: '10',
    },
  ],
}
```

As per our expectations, `explode` on this object should work for `items` and
`offers`, but not on other keys:

```typescript
const result1 = explode(order, 'type') // type error
const result2 = explode(order, 'items') // works
/*
const result2 = [
  {
    id: "111",
    name: "Long sleeve T Shirt",
    price: 15,
    currency: "USD",
    type: "Order",
    customer: {
      name: "Alice",
      address: "123 st.",
    },
    offers: [
      {
        code: "FIRST-CUSTOMER",
        discountPercentage: "20",
      },
      {
        code: "REFFERAL",
        discountPercentage: "10",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "232",
    name: "Jeans",
    price: 12,
    currency: "USD",
    type: "Order",
    customer: {
      name: "Alice",
      address: "123 st.",
    },
    offers: [
      {
        code: "FIRST-CUSTOMER",
        discountPercentage: "20",
      },
      {
        code: "REFFERAL",
        discountPercentage: "10",
      },
    ],
  },
]
*/
const result3 = explode(order, 'offers') // works
/*
const result3 = [
  {
    code: "FIRST-CUSTOMER",
    discountPercentage: "20",
    type: "Order",
    customer: {
      name: "Alice",
      address: "123 st.",
    },
    items: [
      {
        id: "111",
        name: "Long sleeve T Shirt",
        price: 15,
        currency: "USD",
      },
      {
        id: "232",
        name: "Jeans",
        price: 12,
        currency: "USD",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    code: "REFFERAL",
    discountPercentage: "10",
    type: "Order",
    customer: {
      name: "Alice",
      address: "123 st.",
    },
    items: [
      {
        id: "111",
        name: "Long sleeve T Shirt",
        price: 15,
        currency: "USD",
      },
      {
        id: "232",
        name: "Jeans",
        price: 12,
        currency: "USD",
      },
    ],
  },
]
*/
```

We can also check the output types of `result2` and `result3`

```typescript
type Simplify<T> = T extends object
  ? {
      [K in keyof T]: Simplify<T[K]>
    }
  : T

type Result2 = Simplify<typeof result2>

/*
type Result2 = {
  type: string
  customer: {
    name: string
    address: string
  }
  offers: {
    code: string
    discountPercentage: string
  }[]
  id: string
  name: string
  price: number
  currency: string
}[]
*/

type Result3 = Simplify<typeof result3>

/*
type Result3 = {
  type: string
  customer: {
    name: string
    address: string
  }
  items: {
    id: string
    name: string
    price: number
    currency: string
  }[]
  code: string
  discountPercentage: string
}[]
*/
```

We can see that the type result matches the type of execution result, which
made `result2` and `result3` strongly typed, and, caught invalid key in
`result1`, making our `explode` function robust in type domain.
